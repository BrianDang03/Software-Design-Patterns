  <summary>Singleton</summary>
  
  - Definition
    - A software design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to a singular instance. [[i]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern  )
  - How to Implement
    - Implementations of the singleton pattern ensure that only one instance of the singleton class ever exists and typically provide global access to that instance. [[i]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern  ) 
  - Uses Cases
    -  Logging is a common real-world use case for singletons, because all objects that wish to log messages require a uniform point of access and conceptually write to a single source. [[i]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern  )
- Pros
  - The pattern is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across a system. [[i]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern  )
  - Allows classes to ensure only one instance, have easy access to the instance, and control instantiation like hiding a constructor. [[i]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern  )
